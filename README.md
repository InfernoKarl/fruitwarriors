### [Autoclicker](/Scripts/autoclicker.lua) <sub><sup>`v1.0.0` *(Updated: 12/03/2023)*</sup></sub>
Autoclicker for farming stat points, not much else to it. Probably works on any other roblox game too. Not really patchable.

### [Force Combat](/Scripts/forcecombat.lua) <sub><sup>`v1.0.0` *(Updated: 12/03/2023)*</sup></sub>
Force hold the "Combat" tool even if you die, change to whatever you want. Not really patchable.

### [Loop Teleport to Mob](/Scripts/looptp.lua) <sub><sup>`v1.0.0` *(Updated: 12/03/2023)*</sup></sub>
Teleport to whatever mob you want every 5 seconds, really good to use with [Force Combat](/Scripts/forcecombat.lua) and [Autoclicker](/Scripts/autoclicker.lua). Can also be used to teleport to that level 1200 boss, which would farm defense like crazy. Currently working as of *12/03/2023*
